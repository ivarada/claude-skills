# Timeline Configuration Example
# This is a sample configuration for generating timeline SVG

timeline:
  start_year: 2020          # Start year of your timeline
  end_year: 2026            # End year of your timeline
  base_tick_spacing: 25     # Space between ticks (px) - recommended: 25-30
  svg_width: 1000           # Canvas width (px) - recommended: 1000-1200
  tick_lengths:
    year: 100               # Year tick length (px)
    month: 80               # Month tick length (px)
    event: 120              # Event tick length (px)

# Events list

events:
  # Full three-part event
  - date: "2025.11.13"                        # ISO format: YYYY.MM.DD
    title: "Nov 13th"                         # Displayed in BOLD

# - Use meaningful date displays (e.g., "Nov 13th", "Q4 2025")
# - Descriptions should be concise (under 60 characters)
# - Notes are optional - use for supplementary info
# - Date format must be YYYY.MM.DD
# - Events outside the year range will be ignored
